# Gatsby with Firebase and Netlify Functions

A simple example to reproduce issues I'm facing trying to get Firebase and Netlify Functions to play together nicely.

## Prerequisites

- Netlify account
- Firebase account
- Firebase project
- Service account credentials

[This guide](https://leerob.io/blog/real-time-post-views#setting-up-firebase) walks you through setting Firebase up.

Here is a screenshot of the database set up:
![database example](./db-example.png)

When the `/increment?id=test` function endpoint is hit, it should increment `test` under "wizardly-hugle-63a3eb-dot-com".

## Local Development

1. `git clone https://github.com/jsjoeio/gatsby-netlify-firebase-basic.git`
2. `cd gatsby-netlify-firebase-basic`
3. `yarn`
4. Duplicate `.env.example` as `.env` and update values (see photo above)
5. `yarn start`
6. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/.netlify/functions/increment?id=test](http://localhost:8000/.netlify/functions/increment?id=tes)

If it is working as expected, you should see "totalViews" increment each time you hit that endpoint.

## Reproducing issue in Production Environment

1. Connect git repo with Netlify
2. Deploy site
3. Add environment variables

_Note: when you add the `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY` as an env variable, make sure it is inside quotes_

4. Test

_Note: "Firebase Admin SDK requires Node v10 for it to work. By default, Netlify Lambda runs in Node v8 so we'll need to add an environment file that tells Netlify to use v10 on the Lambda instance instead"_

Make sure that you add the enivronment `AWS_LAMBDA_JS_RUNTIME` with the value `nodejs10.x`.
